Analyze the provided French medical MCQ page image and create a detailed repair plan for OCR and AI-based text extraction optimized for LLM processing. Identify issues that interfere with clean content extraction and provide step-by-step remediation instructions.

**Your analysis should examine:**
- Correction pen/whiteout covering text, prefixes, or question numbers
- Pen marks, scratches, or handwritten annotations
- User highlighting, underlining, or answer markings  
- Folded corners or physical damage obscuring content
- Question numbering issues or missing elements
- Answer option prefix problems (A, B, C, D, etc.)
- Missing or partially hidden words that can be inferred from context
- Medical abbreviations or terminology that are partially obscured

**Context Information:**
- If provided with previous page question counts/numbers, use this to determine correct question numbering sequence
- Never alter or change the actual medical content - only provide repair instructions
- Preserve all French medical terminology exactly as intended

**Output Format:**
Question-by-question repair plan:
* Question [number]: [Brief description of issue(s) found]
  - Fix: [Step-by-step instructions with confidence level (high/medium/low) and most practical solution]

**Example format:**
* Question 13: Option prefixes hidden with correction pen
  - Fix: Add standard MCQ prefixes A-, B-, C-, D-, E- to each option (high confidence - standard format)
* Question 14: Word partially obscured by pen mark in question stem  
  - Fix: Most probable word based on medical context is "diagnostic" (medium confidence)
* Question 15: Text completely illegible due to fold damage
  - Fix: Mark section as "[illegible - requires manual review]" and note position for human verification (low confidence)
