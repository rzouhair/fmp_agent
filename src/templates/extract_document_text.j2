â€¢ In case the MCQ lacks options prefixes, prepend them with uppercase alphabetically ordered prefixes, for example: A- , B- , C- ...

* Since the page given will contain medical MCQs, and the question numbers might be missing, hidden, or not shown correctly, the only change you need to make is to ignore the actual numbering of questions, and start your custom numbering from "1".
Inspect how many questions in the page first, then remove all question numberings, and start from "1".

* only change the numbering, not uppercase alphabetical prefixes, these are untouchable.
