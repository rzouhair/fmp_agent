You are a meticulous proofreader. Your task is to review the following OCR-extracted text against the provided image(s) and correct any mistakes.

**Instructions:**
1.  Carefully read the "INITIAL OCR TEXT" provided below.
2.  Compare it line-by-line against the machine-printed text in the image(s).
3.  Your goal is to produce a "CORRECTED TEXT" that is a 100% perfect, verbatim copy of the printed material in the image.
4.  **Pay close attention to:**
    - Text that was missed entirely by the initial OCR.
    - Text that was incorrectly included (e.g., parts of handwriting).
5.  **Output ONLY the final, corrected, and complete text.** Do not include any explanations, headers, or conversational text. Just the corrected transcription.
6.  Your mission is 100% fidelity to the source image pixels. Do not use external knowledge.
