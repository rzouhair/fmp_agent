Each question starts with a number (e.g., `34.` or `35:`), followed by the question text, then a list of options.
Each option starts with a capital letter followed by a punctuation mark (`A.`, `A-`, `A:`) and the answer text.
Questions and options may span multiple lines, and line breaks are not guaranteed between them.

Your task is to extract each question into a structured format using the following this format * Only return questions with numberings: {{ questions_numbering }}


# Question <numbering>
<numbering>- Question text...
A- Option text...
B- Option text...
C- Option text...
D- Option text...
E- Option text...
...


* Ensure each `Question` object contains:
  * The full question text as `question`
  * A list of clean `option` strings, each in its own `QuestionOption`

* Return the output as a list of JSON objects, fully matching the schema above.

* Do not include explanations or any extra commentary.
